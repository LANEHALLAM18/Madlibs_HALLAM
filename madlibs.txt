	I have been using dial up intenet to (eat) all the tasks listed in our homework and it has caused a lot of problems. (Dancing) in the internet made it (fantastically)  impossible to get my homework done. Everything took ten times longer to upload. The wifi in our neighborhood was (super) so I had to use this dinosaur like method to proceed. It became my last resort as all my data usage had been over used on my personal hotspot and I also had no home wifi.
	I believe the home (skillet) was out due to the storm as all of our (chickens) had experienced similar problems. Unfortunately the problem was not resolved as quickly as I had hoped. I had a true appreciation for (slippery) internet after enduring through the turmoil of the super slow internet coupled with the anxiety of trying to (prance) my home work.
